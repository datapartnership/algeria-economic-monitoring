# Labor Market Analysis in Algeria

To analyze labour market trends in Algeria we analyse two alternative datasets - LinkedIn and World Development Indicators. 

## Data Description

This analysis utilizes three key metrics from LinkedIn's Economic Graph to analyze labor market dynamics in South Asia:

### **LinkedIn Hiring Rate (LHR)**
Hiring Rate measures the proportion of LinkedIn members who report starting new jobs each month, providing a real-time indicator of labor market activity.
**Calculation:**  
  - LHR = (Members who added new employers) / (Total country members)  
  - Indexed to the **2016 average** (a value of **1.0** represents the hiring rate of an average month in 2016)
**Presentation:**  
  - Reported as **year-over-year (YOY) percentage changes**, capturing labor market trends relative to the same period in the previous year.
  - Enables **timely month-to-month comparisons** by normalizing fluctuations in hiring patterns.
**Adjustments:**  
  - Accounts for **profile update lags**, ensuring that hiring trends are not skewed by delays in job status changes on LinkedIn.
  - Normalized to remove seasonal hiring variations and provide a clearer picture of underlying labor market dynamics.

### 2. Skills Genome
Provides an ordered list of most characteristic skills for any entity (occupation, country, industry). It uses the Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to identify representative skills. The IF-IDF algorithm is a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract the most 'unique' skills. The algorithm essentially allows for a 'weighting' to be created for unique skills. For example, 'Microsoft Word' is a common skill but not a unique skill to a specific job market. Hence, it will be weighted less based on the number of different places it appears. Further details about the methodology can be found [here](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/827991542143093021/pdf/World-Bank-Group-LinkedIn-Data-Insights-Jobs-Skills-and-Migration-Trends-Methodology-and-Validation-Results.pdf). 

The current dataset being analyzed is the 'POOLED' Skills Genome which shows skills across the years of 2017 - 2023. 


### 3. Skills Penetration
- Measures the prevalence of skill groups within industries and countries, offering insights into workforce specialization and competitiveness.
- Based on the top 50 skills per country-industry combination, ensuring a robust and representative sample.
- Calculated through three key steps:
  1. **National industry skill penetration calculation** – Determines the share of a given skill group within a specific country-industry combination.
  2. **Global industry benchmark estimation** – Establishes an average penetration level for each industry at a global scale.
  3. **Relative penetration value computation** – Compares the national industry value against the global benchmark.

- **Interpretation of Values:**
  - **Values > 1** indicate an above-global-average penetration for a skill group within a country-industry.
  - **Values < 1** indicate a below-global-average penetration.

- **Scope:**
  - Covers **249 skill categories** derived from LinkedIn's **35,000 recognized skills**.
  - Utilizes a dataset spanning **multiple industries and countries**, enabling cross-country and cross-industry comparisons.

The **relative skill penetration metric** allows for meaningful comparisons across countries while accounting for occupational distribution differences on LinkedIn. 

For example, if the **relative tech skill penetration** for **India’s healthcare industry** is **1.2**, this means that the proportion of tech-related skills in India's healthcare workforce is **120% of the global average**, **holding constant for occupational distributions**. This adjustment ensures that differences are not driven by varying workforce compositions across countries but rather by actual skill prevalence.



### Limitations
- Data represents LinkedIn members only
- Coverage varies by country and industry
- Professional network bias in representation
- Industry classifications follow LinkedIn's taxonomy

## Gender Classification

Gender identity isn’t binary and we recognize that some LinkedIn members identify beyond the traditional gender constructs of “men” and “women.” If not explicitly self-identified, we have inferred the gender of members included in this analysis either by the pronouns used on their LinkedIn profiles, or inferred on the basis of first name. Members whose gender could not be inferred as either man or women were excluded from this analysis.

| Skill                            | Potential Bandwidth (Mbps)              | Assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Source                      |

| YouTube Marketing                | Download: 2.5–5 Mbps; Upload: 1+ Mbps   | Involves streaming and uploading videos on YouTube. Smooth HD video streaming (720p–1080p) requires around 2.5–5 Mbps download, and uploading content (e.g., marketing videos) works efficiently with at least ~1 Mbps or more upload speed.                                                                                                        | https://www.highspeedinternet.com/resources/how-internet-connection-speeds-affect-watching-hd-youtube-videos |
| Music                            | Download: 0.5–1 Mbps                    | Primarily involves streaming music online. Audio streaming services use relatively little bandwidth (on the order of a few hundred Kbps), so about 0.5–1 Mbps download speed is sufficient for uninterrupted music playback.                                                                                                                        | https://www.highspeedinternet.com/resources/how-much-speed-do-i-need-for-pandora-and-spotify                 |
| Search Engine Optimization (SEO) | Download: 1–2 Mbps                      | SEO work entails heavy web browsing and use of online analytics tools, mostly loading text and small images. This is similar to general office internet use, which only needs on the order of 1–2 Mbps download for smooth performance.                                                                                                             | https://blog.frontier.com/2020/03/how-much-speed-do-you-need-to-do-your-job-from-home/                       |
| Facebook Marketing               | Download: 1–2 Mbps; Upload: 3–4 Mbps    | Involves managing Facebook pages, viewing multimedia content, and uploading posts (images/videos). Basic browsing of the feed works with ~1–2 Mbps down, but high-quality video uploads or live streaming on Facebook Live require around 3–4 Mbps upload for 720p HD content.                                                                      | https://gyre.pro/blog/what-is-a-good-upload-speed-for-streaming                                              |
| Video Editing                    | Download: 10–50 Mbps; Upload: 5–10 Mbps | Video editing often involves downloading large raw video files and uploading edited videos. To work efficiently (especially with HD/4K footage), a fast connection is needed – potentially tens of Mbps download to retrieve big files without long waits, and a high upload speed (5–10 Mbps or more) to send final video files or share projects. | https://blog.frontier.com/2020/03/how-much-speed-do-you-need-to-do-your-job-from-home/                       |
